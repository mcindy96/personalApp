1) remove the insecure package and use Meteor methods for all of your database operations
Used Metor methods in addActivities and schedule page.

2) run a user test on your app with two people in class and get their feedback on your app
Jarrett: Need more functionality. Website looks nice.
Steven: The nav bar was confusing. "Schedule it" should be changed to "Search". Add more in the home page.

3) create a branch using pure CSS in addition to  bootstrap  and use flexboxes and media queries
to get responsive design.
Flexboxes used in home page and addActivities page. Media queries used in navigation
bar such that when you shrink the page you only see the "home" and "login" option so
you have to click on the right side of the nav bar to get all the rest of the options.
I am trying to make it so that it will drop down and show a list of the options --still
trying to figure out how. CSS used on nav bar as well and button on addActivities page.

4) make it more useable
You can now put all your information on schedule page and addActivities page, and then
view your responses after clicking submit button.
